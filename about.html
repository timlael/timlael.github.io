						<h2 class="title">Professional</h2>
						<p class="meta">&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Posted by <a href="#About">Tim M. Lael</a> on May 18, 2017&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;</p>
						<div class="entry">
							<p><img src="images/growth.png" alt="" class="alignleft" />&emsp;My professional life has always been motivated by two things -
								Challenge and Curiosity. When I was a child, I was constantly disassembling my toys and electronics to see what was inside
								and just how they functioned. That love for figuring things out, breaking them in the process and then fixing them set me off
								on the path that led me to where I am today.
							</p>
							<p>&emsp;I began working for my grandfather on the family farm when I was only 11 or 12 years old. Besides learning to drive cars,
								trucks and tractors of all shapes and sizes at this young age, it fostered my curiosity in the design and function of things.
								Repair, rather than replacement, was a regular part of farm equipment maintenance. Creating and fixing things became second
								nature. It was fun... I enjoyed it... and I was good at it.
							</p>
							<p>&emsp;In high school I used this passion to win the Vocational and Industrial Clubs of America (VICA) (Now Skills USA) Illinois
								State Championships in Diesel Equipment Technology. That win propelled me off to hone my skills at Denver Automotive and Diesel
								College and shortly thereafter, in 1993, landed me a job as a line technician at Saturn of Springfield Illinois. A line technician
								is a fancy name for a mechanic that is factory trained to repair all systems on the vehicle. This was an exciting and challenging
								time to be a line tech. On board diagnostics (OBD) was reaching its maturity and the second generation of OBD, OBD-II, was in its
								infancy. My love for fixing things and my hobby of computers had been married. I thrived as a technician at Saturn for 7+ years
								before a move and marriage created opportunity for the next stage in my career.
							</p>
							<p>&emsp;Shortly after moving to the St. Louis area, I landed a job that connected my love for cars and computers in a job that
								seemed as if was scripted just for me. I began working as a Vehicle Testing/Data Analyst for Hunter Engineering Company - a
								manufacturer of automotive service equipment which I was familiar with from my years at Saturn and on the farm. It was there that
								I would spend the next 14+ years in the engineering department creating tools and software to help technicians repair and maintain
								cars as I once had done. The work was exciting and challenging at first, then the challenge began to fade after many years.
							</p>
							<p>&emsp;The desire to stay challenged and relevant turned the page to the current chapter in the pursuit of the perfect job. In 2011,
								I decided to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Since I was already involved in a technical position developing and
								maintaining	software, the move seemed like the next logical step. With my studies complete in early 2017, I began my search for a
								full-time software development position.

							<p><img src="images/run.jpg" width="186" height="186" alt="" class="alignleft" />&emsp;In my free time away from work and tinkering with
								various home improvement projects, I enjoy an uneven (and somewhat odd) mix of distance running, cigars, road cycling and homebrewing.
							</p>
							<p>&emsp;I started homebrewing around 2010 and began entering competitions shortly thereafter. In 2011, I had a beer advance to the
								final round of the National Homebrew Competition and in 2012, I had the same recipe place
								<a href="http://www.masterhomebrewer.org/json/2012/winners.html">second</a> in the <a href="http://www.masterhomebrewer.org/">Masters Championship of
								Amateur Brewing</a>. Unfortunately, as I became more involved in school and my workload increased, brewing was forced to take a back
								seat. Hopefully, that will soon change and I will find the time to brew again and place many of my award winning recipes back into regular rotation.
							</p>
							<p>&emsp;My newest hobby - distance running - was born from a bet my wife made with me in 2013. Challenged to get in shape to run a 5k, I tackled that
								goal and went a tad further. In October 2014, I ran my first full marathon, the 2014 St. Louis Rock n' Roll in a time of 4:10:11. The following May, I ran the
								<a href="http://runabe.srrc.net">Lincoln Presidential Half Marathon</a> in a time of 1:51:32 which secured a decent starting spot for me in the
								2015 Bank of America Chicago Marathon. That race humbled me. It was an abnormally warm October day and I ended up finishing - <i>barely</i> - in 4:20:18.
								In January of 2016, I suffered an undiagnosed ankle injury which has kept me from training seriously and force me into cycling in an attempt to stay in shape.
								I also plan to revive my running habit very soon now that I have some free time.
